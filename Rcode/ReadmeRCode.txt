All R Code files that are not global.R, ui.R, and server.R should go in this folder.

This could include: 
-Markdown/Quarto files that explain certain processes (Markdown subfolder).
-Module files (Module subfolder). These are code chunks corresponding to significant sub-components (modules) of the app that have been sectioned off for ease of maintenance. 
-Convenience scripts (Scripts subfolder). These are R Script files that contain custom code, such as convenience functions, that can be sourced by global.R or by other files in the app.
