This subfolder is for storing input files and scripts needed to churn out the input files the app actually pulls from when it runs. Ideally, complex processes are not performed while the app is running; instead, input files are as "pre-baked" as possible. As such, any "pre-baking" we can/need to do is performed using files stored in this folder and that write out to the inputs sub-folder for "made upstream" inputs.
