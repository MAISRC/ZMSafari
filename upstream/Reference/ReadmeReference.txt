This is a folder I use to store "important one-off" code. For example, if I had to make a single, complex change to an input file, I might store the R Script I built and used to perform that adjustment in this folder. That way, if I ever need to do something similar, or if I need to understand more about how or why I made a specific change in the past, I can reference the files stored in this folder.
